# Quick Start Guide
## Through Eclipse IDE
### Compiling the file:
* The cache simulator is entirely coded in Java, which means it will run independently on any machine as long as you have JRE installed
* We recommend using an IDE such as Eclipse and downloading our files into a java project for easy compilation and testing. 
### Running the Progam:
 * Our program initializes the RAM with a given text file that contains a btye of memory per line. This is text file in added through the command line interface. In Eclipse, this can be hard to find.
 1. To access command line arguments, you first want to scroll over to the "Run" tab, click it, then click on "Run Configurations...".

 3. After adding your input file directory, you are free to click the run button and experiment with your very own cache-simulation.
 ## Through Command Line Interface
 ### Compiling the file:
* To compile the program through the command line/terminal, type "javac <filename.java>" for each file, or "javac <list of filenames separated by SPACE>".
### Running the Progam:
 * To run the compiled program, type "java Driver <input-file>".
