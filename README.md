# Cache-Emulator
### Compiling the file:
* The cache simulator is entirely coded in Java, which means it will run independently on any machine as long as you have JRE installed
* We recommend using an IDE such as Eclipse and downloading our files into a java project for easy compilation and testing. 
### Running the Progam:
* It's import that you replace edit line 12 in the Initialization class, where util is instantiated and defined, to have the directory path of your input.txt file.
