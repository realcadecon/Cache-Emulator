# Cache-Emulator
### Compiling the file:
* The cache simulator is entirely coded in Java, which means it will run independently on any machine as long as you have JRE installed
* We recommend using an IDE such as Eclipse and downloading our files into a java project for easy compilation and testing. 
### Running the Progam:
* It's import that you replace edit line 12 in the Initialization class to contain the directory path of your input.txt file instead of what is already there.

* After adding your input file directory, you are free to click the run button and experiment with your very own cache-simulation.
* Enjoy!!
